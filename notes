////////////////////////////////////////State
State is basically data that is mutated in your component
 while a component can't change its own props, it can change its state.
State is used to handle several things in your component:
 Interactivity (e.g. changing data when a user clicks a button)
 Fetching remote data (remote data is, by definition, not available right away when the component is mounted â€”
  state gives us a way of updating the component once that data arrives)
 Reacting to the passing of time (i.e. setting an interval or timeout)

 State vs Prop
 The best way to figure out if data should go in props or state is to ask ourselves 'Will this data ever change?'.
  If not, it's a prop. If it will, it should go in state!


 follow along by running npm install && npm start in your terminal.

 example:
  A toggle button has an on and off state. Using props for that value wouldn't work, since we can't actually change our props!
  /////// state example:
  // src/components/ToggleButton.js
  import React from 'react';
    class ToggleButton extends React.Component {
    constructor() {
      super();
      this.state = { isEnabled: false     }
    }
    render() {
      return (
        <button className="toggle-button">
          I am toggled {this.state.isEnabled ? 'on' : 'off'}
        </button>
      )    }  }
  export default ToggleButton;
  // src/components/Address.js
  import React from 'react';
  class Address extends React.Component {
    constructor(props){
      super(props);
      this.state = { fullAddress: `${props.street},${props.city}`}
    }
    render(){
      return(
        <div className="address">
          {/* { this.state.fullAddress}  below is better than this */}
          {this.props.street}, {this.props.city}
        </div>
      );    }  }//class
  export default Address;
  // src/index.js
  import React from 'react';
  import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';
  import ToggleButton from './components/ToggleButton'
  import Address from './components/Address'
  ReactDOM.render(
    // <div>Components Need To Be Mounted</div>,
    <div>
      <ToggleButton />
      <Address
        street="Santa Monica Blvd."
        city="Santa Monica"
      />
    </div>
    ,
    document.getElementById('root')
  )
